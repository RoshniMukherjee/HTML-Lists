        <strong>Step1: Preheat the oven:</strong>
        <p>
          Preheat your oven to 475¬∞F (245¬∞C). If you have a pizza stone, place
          it in the oven while preheating.

          Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired
          thickness.

        <strong>Step 3: Add sauce and toppings:</strong>
        <p>
          Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border
          around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the
          sauce, then add your desired toppings.

          the hot stone. If not, place the pizza on a baking sheet lined with
          parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or
          until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
